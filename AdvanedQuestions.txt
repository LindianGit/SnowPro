11.  
An Architect is analyzing a slow-running query using the `QUERY_HISTORY` function in Snowflake. They observe that the `COMPILATION_TIME` for the query is significantly greater than the `EXECUTION_TIME`. Which of the following best explains this observation?

A) The query is waiting for resources due to warehouse queuing.  
B) The query execution is delayed due to network latency between client and Snowflake.  
C) The query is complex, possibly involving dynamic SQL, extensive parsing, or large numbers of objects, which increases the time required for query compilation compared to execution.  
D) The data required for the query is stored in a remote region, causing high data transfer times.  

**Correct Answer:** C

---

**Explanation:**  
When `COMPILATION_TIME` is greater than `EXECUTION_TIME`, it typically means the query is complex to parse, plan, or optimize, often involving dynamic SQL, lots of objects/tables, or complicated logic. The actual execution (reading and processing data) is relatively fast, but most time is spent preparing the query.


12. A Snowflake Architect is investigating a query that has a much higher COMPILATION_TIME than EXECUTION_TIME in the QUERY_HISTORY results. Which scenario is most likely causing this observation?

A) The warehouse was suspended and had to be resumed before the query could execute.
B) The query references many objects, such as multiple tables or complex views, causing Snowflake to spend more time parsing and optimizing before execution.
C) The underlying data files are heavily compressed, slowing down data retrieval.
D) The network connection between the client and Snowflake was interrupted during execution.

Correct Answer: B

If you are using the `--mfa-passcode-in-password` flag with SnowSQL and the password prompt is forced (such as with `-P`), the password you enter should be a **concatenation of your Snowflake password and your current MFA token**.

Given your example:
- **Snowflake password:** SNOWFLAKE
- **MFA token:** 123456

**The password you should enter at the prompt will be:**
```
SNOWFLAKE123456
```

**Explanation:**  
You simply append the current 6-digit MFA code to the end of your normal password, with no spaces or separators. So in this case, enter `SNOWFLAKE123456` as the password when prompted.

Here are two scenario-based questions related to using the `--mfa-passcode-in-password` flag with SnowSQL, with randomized correct answer positions:

---

A) 654321Winter2025  
B) Winter2025-654321  
C) Winter2025654321  
D) Winter2025 654321  

**Correct Answer:** C

Here is a scenario-based Snowflake Snowpro Architect exam question regarding how Snowflake determines the active warehouse for a session, with randomized answer placement:

---

**1.**  
A user connects to Snowflake and starts a new session. The user does not explicitly specify a warehouse in their query. In what order does Snowflake determine which warehouse to use for the session?

A) Role default warehouse → User default warehouse → Account default warehouse → No active warehouse  
B) User default warehouse → Role default warehouse → Account default warehouse → No active warehouse  
C) User default warehouse → Account default warehouse → Role default warehouse → No active warehouse  
D) Account default warehouse → User default warehouse → Role default warehouse → No active warehouse  

**Correct Answer:** B

---

**Explanation:**  
Snowflake determines the active warehouse for a session in the following hierarchy:  
1. The warehouse specified by the user in the session  
2. The user’s default warehouse  
3. The role’s default warehouse  
4. The account’s default warehouse
